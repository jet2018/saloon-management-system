# Simple guide to run the project
Please for the project to keep running smoothly, first run adminhome and create a user or add a user manually in the database, provide admin previlages to this user since it is this admin that will create other workers and admins too
Get to the saloon section and add info about your saloon

Then run the login.java to login as either an admin or worker...

The rest will be simple for you to figure out

# Freedom over the project
I provide this freely for you, please you are even free to reproduce it for your fit

# System's capacities
Registering members that is both workers and administrators
Adding customers
Producing reports 
Registering new hair styles
Adding discounts on these hair styles

Viewing all workers, admins, discounts, defaulters,etc as will be discovered in the system


# NOTE:
PLease you need to change or entirely remove the passoword as my mysql here requires a password to run, but yours might not since am running on linux
